A game to teach preschoolers the alphabet

The Alphabet Learning Game is a fun and education game made for children to help teach them the alphabet and words. In this game, you see an image and have to select the corresponding letter in order to get the highest score. 
To achieve this, I have used techniques like GUI, graphics, colors, music, images, score recording, layout tools, and more.

When you first run the game, you will be asked for your name. Input your name and the game will start. The game will show you a clue image. Choose the letter that the image starts with. If you get it right, you will gain a point and a checkmark will be displayed. If you get it wrong, you will lose a point and a wrong symbol will appear. Your score will be displayed in the top right corner. You can check the top scores, pause the game, and exit the games by pressing buttons in the top left.
